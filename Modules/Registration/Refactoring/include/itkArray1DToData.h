/** \class Array1DToData
 *  \brief Class for custom threading setup and dispatch of 1D data.
 *
 * This class provides threading over 1D data.
 * The SplitRequestedObject method splits the provided IndexRange into
 * 1 or more inclusive sub-ranges.
 * IndexRange is treated as an inclusive range, and need
 * not start at 0.
 *
 * Call SetOverallIndexRange to define the IndexRange over which to thread.
 * Call SetThreadedGenerateData to define the worker callback function,
 *  which during threading is called from each thread with a unique range
 *  to process.
 * Call SetHolder to provide a class instance...
