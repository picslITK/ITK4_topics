/** \class ImageToData
 *  \brief Base class for all process objects that output image data.
 *
 * ImageToData is the base class for all process objects that output
 * image data. Specifically, this class defines the GetOutput() method
 * that returns a pointer to the output image. The class also defines
 * some internal private data members that are used to manage streaming
 * of data.
 *
 * Memory management in an ImageToData is slightly different than a
 * standard ProcessObject.  ProcessObject's always release the bulk
 * data associated with their output prior to GenerateData() being
 * called. ImageSources default to not releasing the bulk data incase
 * that particular memory block is large enough to hold the new output
 * values.  This avoids unnecessary deallocation/allocation
 * sequences. ImageToData's can be forced to use a memory management
 * model similar to the default ProcessObject behaviour by calling
 * ProcessObject::ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlagOn().  A user may want to
 * set this flag to limit peak memory usage during a pipeline update.

//  [33.2] How do I pass a pointer-to-member-function to a signal handler, X event callback, system call that starts a thread/task, etc?
//  Don't.
//  so this call back function has to be define outside of the class OR use static function instead
//
//  Note: static member functions do not require an actual object to be invoked,
//  so pointers-to-static-member-functions are usually type-compatible with regular
//  pointers-to-functions. However, although it probably works on most compilers, it
//  actually would have to be an extern "C" non-member function to be correct,
//  since "C linkage" doesn't only cover things like name mangling, but also calling
//  conventions, which might be different between C and C++.
