/** \class ImageToData
 *  \brief Class for custom threading setup and dispatch of Image data.
 *
 * This class provides threading over an ImageRegion. It provides a
 * \c SplitRequestedObject method that splits the provided ImageRegion into
 * subregions, along the z-axis. Additionally it makes setting up a threaded
 * operation easier.
 *
 * Call SetOverallRegion to define the ImageRegion over which to thread.
 * Call SetThreadedGenerateData to define the worker callback function,
 *  which is called from each thread with a unique region to process.
 *\warning This callback function must be \c static if it is a class method.
 *
 * Call \c SetHolder to provide a pointer to DataHolder object to
 * store arbitrary user data for use in the threader callback
 * (typically a class instance).
 *
 * Call GenerateData to begin threaded processing.
 *
 * This class is templated over image dimension and DataHolder type.
 * The third template parameter \c TInputObject should always be
 * left as default.
 *
 * \warning The actual number of threads used may be less than the
 * requested number of threads. Either because the requested number is
 * greater than the number available, or the SplitRequestedObject method
 * decides that fewer threads would be more efficient. After the threader
 * has run, m_NumberOfThreadsUsed holds the actual number used.
 * See \c DetermineNumberOfThreadsToUse to get the number of threads
 * before running.
