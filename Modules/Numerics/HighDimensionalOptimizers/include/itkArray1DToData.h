/** \class Array1DToData
 *  \brief Class for custom threading setup and dispatch of 1D data.
 *
 * This class provides threading over 1D data.
 * The SplitRequestedObject method splits the provided IndexRange into
 * 1 or more inclusive sub-ranges.
 * IndexRange is treated as an inclusive range, and need
 * not start at 0.
 *
 * This class is templated over the type of data object that holds
 * user data for use in the threaded callback.
 *
 * Call SetOverallIndexRange to define the IndexRange over which to thread.
 * Call SetThreadedGenerateData to define the worker callback function,
 *  which during threading is called from each thread with a unique range
 *  to process.
 * Call SetHolder to provide a pointer to user data.
 * Call GenerateData to begin processing.
 *
 * \warning The actual number of threads used may be less than the
 * requested number of threads. Either because the requested number is
 * greater than the number available, or the SplitRequestedObject method
 * decides that fewer threads would be more efficient. After the threader
 * has run, m_NumberOfThreadsUsed holds the actual number used.
 * See \c DetermineNumberOfThreadsToUse to get the number of threads
 * before running.
