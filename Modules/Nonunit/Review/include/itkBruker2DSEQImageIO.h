 * \brief Class that defines how to read Bruker file format.
 * Bruker IMAGE FILE FORMAT - The following is a brief description of the Bruker
 * file format taken from:
 *
 * http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/Common/brukerformat.shtml.
 *
 * For the Bruker format, a single scanning session is stored in its own
 * directory. The directory is named according to the subject name or number, as
 * typed in by the scanner operator. The directory name usually specifies the
 * subject name/number and which session this is for that subject. Thus, a
 * typical directory name would be
 *
 *         010005-m00.5X1
 *
 * where '010005' is the WBIC subject number of the subject, the 00 of 'm00'
 * means this is the first scanning session that subject number of the session
 * for that subject, on that day (1). The first two letters specify the day,
 * since some arbitrary base date - set in the Bruker software.
 *
 * The WBIC number (e.g. 010005) in turn is made up of the year the subject was
 * first scanned (01 = 2001) and where that subject is in the sequence of new
 * numbers allocated (5 = 5th subject in the year 2001 who has needed a new
 * subject number).
 *
 * Within the session directory (e.g 010005-m00.5X1), there are:
 *          1.  a text file, named 'subject'
 *          2.  A subdirectory numbered 1, 2, 3 etc, for each saved run of data
 *              acquisition in that session
 *
 * Within each of the run directories (e.g. 010005-m00.5X1/5) there are the
 * following:
 *          1.  an 'imnd' or 'method' text file, containing parameters used in
 *              setting up and acquiring the data from the scanner
 *          2.  an 'acqp' (ACquisition Parameter) text file, with further details
 *              of the acquisition parameters used for that run
 *          3.  a large 'fid' file, that contains the raw, unreconstructed MR
 *              Free Induction Decay data
 *          4.  a subdirectory 'pdata' (Processed Data), that contains any
 *              reconstructions of the data into images
 *          5.  various other files, including the 'pulseprogram' and 'grdprog.r'
 *              gradient programs
 *
 * Within each of the 'pdata' subdirectories (e.g 01001-m00.5X1/5/pdata), there
 * are numbered subdirectories (1,2,3 etc) for each new reconstruction of the raw
 * data into images. There is usually only one such reconstruction, in
 * subdirectory '1'.
 *
 * Within each reconstruction directory (e.g 01001-m00.5X1/5/pdata/1), there are:
 *          1.  a '2dseq' file. This is the 3D (structural etc) or 4D (FMRI)
 *              image file.  It is simply a binary block of data, which could
 *              simply be renamed as 'myscan.img' to make an acceptable Analyze
 *              .img file.
 *          2.  a 'reco' text file, containing some details of the
 *              reconstruction.
 *          3.  a 'meta' text file, which I think contains information for the
 *              display of the 2dseq file within ParaVision.
 *          4.  a 'd3proc' file, containing image size definition parameters,
 *              inter alia.
 *
 * The 'reco', 'acqp', 'd3proc', and '2dseq' files are required for this reader.
 * It will look for these files in the directory structure described above.  The
 * path and filename of the '2dseq' file must be the name of the file to read
 * (see CanReadFile).  This class supports reading only.
