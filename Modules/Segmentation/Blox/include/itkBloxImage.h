/**
 * \class BloxImage
 * \brief Templated n-dimensional image class used to store linked lists.
 *
 * The itk::BloxImage object is a regular, rectilinear lattice of "blocks" in
 * n-dimensional space.  The word "blox" was chosen to bring to mind a set of
 * "city blocks" in 2D or "building blocks" in 3D.  Being a regular lattice,
 * itkBloxImage logically derives from itkImage.  In an itkBloxImage, each
 * pixel represents an isometric space-filling block of geometric space, called
 * an itkBloxPixel.  Each itk::BloxPixel generally covers many pixels in the
 * underlying image and is used to store a variable number of image primitives
 * (such as boundary points) or features (such as medial nodes) gathered within
 * that region of geometric space.  To do this, each itkBloxPixel contains a
 * linked list.
 *
 * The itk::BloxImage object facilitates certain forms of analysis by providing
 * geometric hashing.  For example, if boundary points are stored in an
 * itk::BloxImage, pairs of boundary points that face each other
 * (called "core atoms") can be found by searching relatively small regions of
 * geometric space that face each boundary point for appropriate mates.
 * Because an itk::BloxImage is rectilinear in geometric space (even though the
 * underlying image may not be) subsequent analysis can be invariant to
 * rotation and translation.
 *
 * itk::BloxImage is templated over pixel type; in general, the pixel type
 * should be derived from itk::BloxPixel, however this is not enforced and
 * other implementations are possible.
 *
 * Note that itk::BloxPixel is itself templated over item type (the type of
 * object stored in the linked list).
