set(DOCUMENTATION "This module contains filters that implement variations of
Curvature Flow. This is a technique that uses an iterative solution of partial
differential equations to implement image denoising image filtering. These
classes are typically used as edge-preserving smoothing filters. You may find
useful as well to look at the Smoothing and ITK-AnisotropicSmoothing modules.")
