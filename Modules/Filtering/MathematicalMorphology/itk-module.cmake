set(DOCUMENTATION "This module contains classes that implement variations of
mathematical morphology techniques. In addition to the classical erosion,
dilation, opening and closing filters, you will find here geodesic operations,
maxima and minima filters, and reconstruction filters. This module contains
filters for both binary and grayscale mathematical morphology.")
