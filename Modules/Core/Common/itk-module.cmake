set(DOCUMENTATION "This module contains the central classes of the ITK
toolkit.  They include, basic data structures \(such as Points, Vectors,
Images, Regions\) the core of the process objects \(such as base
classes for image filters\) the pipeline infrastructure classes, the support
for multi-threading, and a collection of classes that isolate ITK from
platform specific features. It is anticipated that most other ITK modules will
depend on this one.")
